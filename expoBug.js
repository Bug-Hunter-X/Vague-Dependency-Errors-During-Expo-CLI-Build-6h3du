While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to a missing or improperly configured dependency.  The error message was vague, only mentioning a general failure during the build process.  The exact error message varied depending on the specific dependency involved. The app was running fine until I added a package using `expo install <package_name>`, after which I started seeing this issue.
