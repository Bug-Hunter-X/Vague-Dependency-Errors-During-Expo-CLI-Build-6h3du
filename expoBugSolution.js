The core issue is often related to missing native dependencies or discrepancies between the package versions. To resolve this, carefully review your `package.json` and ensure all dependencies are correctly specified, including their versions.  

1. **Verify Package.json:** Check for any missing or incorrect dependency entries. Pay attention to version numbers and make sure they are compatible with Expo. 
2. **Clean and Rebuild:** Use `expo prebuild` and `expo run:android` or `expo run:ios` to force a clean build and resolve any cached dependencies that may be causing conflicts. 
3. **Check Native Dependencies:** Examine your app's native code modules.  Ensure they're compatible with the versions specified in your `package.json`.  Consider updating or reinstalling them. 
4. **Check Expo SDK Version:**  Make sure your Expo SDK version is up-to-date and compatible with your dependencies. 
5. **Examine Error Messages Carefully:** While often vague, the error messages might provide subtle clues about the specific dependency issue. Look for hints in the full build output.

Example (expoBugSolution.js):
```javascript
// ... assuming the issue was with a react-native-maps dependency...
expo install react-native-maps --save //or use yarn
// Clean and rebuild the project
expo prebuild
expo run:android
```
